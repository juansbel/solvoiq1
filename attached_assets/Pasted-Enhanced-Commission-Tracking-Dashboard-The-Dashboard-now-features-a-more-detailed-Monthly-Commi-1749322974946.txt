Enhanced Commission Tracking (Dashboard):

The Dashboard now features a more detailed "Monthly Commission Estimator."
It clearly breaks down:
Assigned Team Members: Count of team members linked to clients.
Base Commission (TMs): Calculated from COP_PER_TEAM_MEMBER (84,000 COP) for each assigned team member.
Performance Bonuses: Calculated based on COP_PERFORMANCE_BONUS (16,000 COP) for each team member whose assigned client has all their defined KPIs met.
New Positions Sold: An input field allows you to enter the number of new positions sold, with the bonus calculated using COP_NEW_POSITION_BONUS (300,000 COP).
Total Estimated Commission: A prominent display of the sum of all commission components.
II. Detailed Client KPI Management:

Client Data: SAMPLE_CLIENTS now includes a kpis array for each client. Each KPI object has id, name, target, actual, and met (boolean) properties.
Client Detail Page:
A new "KPIs" tab has been added within the client detail view.
This tab lists all defined KPIs for the selected client, showing their name, target, actual value, and met status with visual indicators.
Edit Client Modal:
When editing a client, you can now view and edit their KPIs. For each KPI, you can modify its name, target, actual value, and toggle its met status.
You can also add new KPIs to a client profile (in sample mode, this adds to the local data).
A client's overall performance (which feeds the commission bonus) is determined if all their defined KPIs are marked as met.
III. Team Member Enhancements:

Data Structure: SAMPLE_TEAM_MEMBERS now includes fields for position, location, teamMemberId, and new arrays for incapacidades (absences) and oneOnOneSessions.
Team Tab:
Each team member card now displays their role, position, location, and TM ID.
A "View/Log" button has been added to each team member card, which opens a new Team Member Detail Modal.
Team Member Detail Modal:
Displays the team member's full information.
1:1 Sessions Section:
Lists past 1:1 sessions with date, discussion points, and action items.
A form to log new 1:1 sessions.
Incapacidades (Absences) Section:
Lists logged incapacidades with start/end dates and reason.
A form to log new incapacidades.
IV. AI-Assisted Communication (Initial UI):

Email Tools Tab (Consolidated): The "Rewrite Email" tab now also includes a button:
"Get AI Response Suggestions": When clicked (after you have some draft or rewritten email content), this simulates an AI call (for now, it will show a loading spinner and then could potentially display a few pre-defined sample suggestions if the aiSuggestions state is populated by a mock function, though the Gemini call is still there if you wish to make it live). The prompt is constructed to ask for alternative phrasings or short response ideas.
AI Analysis & Helpers Tab (Consolidated): The "Analyze Email" tab is now part of a broader "AI Analysis & Helpers" tab, which also includes the new Jira Ticket Helper.
V. Jira Ticket Helper:

New Section in "AI Analysis & Helpers" Tab: A dedicated "Jira Ticket Helper" form.
Form Fields:
Dropdown to select a Team Member (populates from SAMPLE_TEAM_MEMBERS).
Dropdown to select a Client (optional, populates from SAMPLE_CLIENTS).
Textarea for a short issue description.
Functionality: Upon submission, the helper generates a structured text block that includes:
Team Member's full name, ID, position, and location (from sample data).
Associated Client's name, ID, and a mock client code (from sample data).
The user-provided issue description.
Placeholder fields like "Environment" and "Priority."
This generated text is displayed in a read-only textarea with a copy button, ready for you to paste into Jira.
VI. Layout and UI Refinements:

Client Detail Page Tabs: The client detail view now uses an internal tabbed navigation ("Overview", "KPIs", "Logs", "Meetings", "Follow-ups") to better organize the extensive information. The active sub-tab is managed by activeClientDetailTab state.
Sidebar Consolidation: "Rewrite Email" and "Follow-up" features are now conceptually grouped under "Email Tools". "Analyze Email" is grouped with the new "Jira Ticket Helper" under "AI Analysis & Helpers" for better thematic organization in the sidebar.
Visual Consistency: Continued use of commonSectionClass and refined styling for forms, lists, and modals to maintain the clean, modern aesthetic.
New Icons: Added appropriate icons for the new features and sections.
